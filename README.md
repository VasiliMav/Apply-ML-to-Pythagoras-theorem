# Apply-ML-to-Pythagoras-theorem

MRAC01(24/25): Software III - Machine Learning for Robotic Fabrication

DESCRIPTION:

This project explores the application of machine learning to predict the hypotenuse of right-angled triangles. Based on the well-known Pythagorean Theorem, where the hypotenuse \( c \) is computed as:
[ c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \]

OBJECTIVES: 

STEP 1: SYNTHETIC DATA GENERATION 
Generate a dataset of right-angled triangles with random lengths.

STEP 2. USE THE PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM
Compute, apply the mathematical equation of the Pythagorean theorem on the hypotenuse for each triangle.

STEP 2: MODEL TRAINING
Train  a regression model ( Linear Regression) to predict the hypotenuse.

STEP 3: MODEL EVALUATION
Evaluate the model’s predictions against true computed values.

STEP 4: VISUALIZATION
Predict and visualize hypotenuse values based on new user inputs.

STEP 5: USER INPUT AND NEW PREDICTIONS
Give the option to the user to add input for new predictions.
